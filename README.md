I know there are branches, but I'm too lazy.  If it was an npm project, I would have to make these branches

I can maintain old versions of libraries until I complete them, or I don't want to close support

I also want to make the revolt of the oldest versions of this library, so that old devices and weak PCs, as well as modern ones, can use this repository.
