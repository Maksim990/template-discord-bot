## About the project
The project was created in order not to suffer and immediately take a ready-made, but already convenient bot template.
## Discord.js version branches
* discordjs-v11 (archive)
* discordjs-v12 (archive)
* discordjs-v13 (old)
* discordjs-v14 (current)
## Up-to-date new version of the bot template
* template version `v8.0` support discord.js-v13(`nodejs v16.11+`)
* since template-bot `v8.0` compatibility with windows is no longer supported, in case of linux-only libraries you can still use it but without half the functionality
