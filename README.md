## About the project
The project was created in order not to suffer and immediately take a ready-made, but already convenient bot template.
## Discord.js version branches
* discordjs-v11
* discordjs-v12
* discordjs-v13 (current)
* discordjs-v14 (soon)
## Up-to-date new version of the bot template
* template version `v7.2` support discord.js-v13(`nodejs v16.9+`)
* since template-bot `v7.2` compatibility with windows is no longer supported, in case of linux-only libraries you can still use it but without half the functionality
