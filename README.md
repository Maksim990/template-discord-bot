I know there are branches, but I'm too lazy.  If it was an npm project, I would have to make these branches

I can maintain old versions of libraries until I complete them, or I don't want to close support

## Supports versions library discord.js
v11(no)
v12(yes)
v13(new)

## Versions template bot
* v1
* v2
* v3
* v4
* v5 (old)
* v5.1 (new)
